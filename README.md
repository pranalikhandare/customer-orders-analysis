# Customer Orders Analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer order data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help businesses understand their customers better. The dataset includes features such as Order ID, Product ID, Category, Gender, Zone, Amount, State, and Occupation of the customers. The analysis covers the entire pipeline from data cleaning to outlier detection and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Dataset

The dataset contains information about customer orders, including:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order

Product ID: Identifier for the product purchased

Category: Product category

Gender: Gender of the customer

Zone: Geographical zone of the customer

Amount: Purchase amount

State: State of the customer

Occupation: Occupation of the customer

# Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate analysis

Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data

Detect outliers in purchase behavior and other numerical attributes

Explore trends and patterns across different features such as category, gender, zone, and occupation

Generate visual insights to better understand customer behavior

# Key Steps

Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize data formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze distributions, trends, and relationships between features

Outlier Detection: Identify anomalous data points that could impact analysis

Visualization: Use charts and graphs to present insights in a clear, interpretable way

# Key Findings

Distribution of orders across product categories and customer zones

Gender-based and occupation-based purchase patterns

Detection of high-value outliers in purchase amounts

Insights to help businesses make informed decisions
